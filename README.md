# minishell42
The repo for the 42 Network project minishell, by lvincent and gpouzet

The aim of this project is to create a shell mimicking bash behavior to some extent, including:

-pipe handling ("|")

-redirections, in, out, heredoc, and append

-a few builtins (echo, pwd, cd, export, unset and exit)

-a working history

-quotes and double quotes

-and a few more

please feel free to browse the code, and ask questions if needed,
but please if you are a student doing this project, don't copy/paste code you don't understand!
